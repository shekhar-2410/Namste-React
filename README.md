# Namaste-React: Food Ordering Website

Welcome to the "Namaste-React" repository! This project is a React.js web application that leverages various modern web development concepts and technologies to create a food ordering website. Users can explore and order food from nearby restaurants based on their location. The application makes use of React hooks, Redux Toolkit, Bootstrap for styling, and utilizes a JSON folder to store dummy data. Additionally, it incorporates some real-world data from food delivery services to enhance the user experience.

## Key Features

- **React Concepts**: This project showcases the usage of React hooks for state management and component interaction.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Redux is utilized for global state management, and the Redux Toolkit simplifies the setup and usage.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Bootstrap is employed for responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
- **Data Mocking**: Dummy data stored in a JSON folder is used for testing and demonstration purposes.
- **Real-World Data Integration**: Some data from actual food delivery services is included to provide a more realistic user experience.
